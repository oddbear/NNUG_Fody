Examples:

	MyFodyAddin:
	- Replacing method body
	- Adding new "hidden" method
	- Commented out, live coding (question from audience) about exceptions.

	Beeper:
	- Play 1 second annoying sound for each method call

Make own plugin:

	Test in unit tests:
		Run tests from solution.

	Test as nuget:
		run ".\<addinname>.Fody\Nuget\build.bat"
		edit ".\<addinname>.Fody\Nuget\pack.bat" to local folder (or use "C:\Nuget\Feed\")

		Setup a source like: nuget_source.png, but with your own local folder
		Remember to use "include prerelease" with this format

	Magic of Fody:
		(.net classic shows path to target files in csproj, core don't)
		Targets found in "C:\Users\<username>\.nuget\packages\fody\2.3.18\build\Fody.targets"
		Fody addins (downloaded from nuget) found in "C:\Users\<username>\.nuget\packages\<addinname>"
